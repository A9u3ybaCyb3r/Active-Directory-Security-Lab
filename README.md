# Adaptive Threat Detection and Incident Response Lab

## Objective:

To develop a comprehensive understanding of advanced threat detection and incident response techniques by configuring and integrating multiple security tools. This project aims to enhance defensive cybersecurity skills, focusing on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating cyber threats within an Active Directory environment. Through hands-on simulations, the project offers practical insights into building a resilient security framework that aligns with the NIST Incident Response Plan.

## Skills Learned:

- **Intrusion Detection:** Configuring Snort IDS to identify and alert on network-based threats.
- **Endpoint Threat Monitoring and Response:** Using LimaCharlie EDR to detect and contain endpoint threats in real-time.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Setting up and managing Splunk SIEM for log analysis, alert configuration, and network anomaly tracking.
- **Incident Response:** Applying the NIST Incident Response Plan framework to handle each phase of cyber incidents, from detection through to remediation.
- **Threat Analysis:** Leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and Cyber Kill Chain to analyze attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Threat Simulation:** Creating realistic attack simulations, including phishing campaigns, reverse TCP sessions, and persistence tactics, for testing detection and response capabilities.
- **Blue Team Operations:** Building defensive security skills and applying them to monitor, detect, and respond to threats in an Active Directory environment.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Gaining insights into network behavior, identifying suspicious patterns, and filtering malicious traffic.
- **Malware Analysis Fundamentals:** Basic reverse-engineering of malware behaviors, such as persistence and lateral movement, to understand the threat landscape.

## Tools Used in the Lab

This lab leverages various industry-standard tools and frameworks for comprehensive threat detection and incident response:

1. **Snort IDS** - Network intrusion detection system for real-time monitoring and alerting on suspicious network traffic.

2. **LimaCharlie EDR** - Endpoint Detection and Response platform providing continuous endpoint monitoring, threat detection, and response.

3. **Splunk SIEM** - Security Information and Event Management system for log analysis, alerting, and security incident management.

4. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** - Framework for mapping and understanding attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

5. **Cyber Kill Chain** - A model that breaks down each phase of an attack, assisting in identifying and mitigating threats at various stages.

6. **Meterpreter** - A Metasploit payload used to simulate attacks, such as reverse shells, persistence tactics, and lateral movement.

7. **NIST Incident Response Plan** - Structured framework for managing each phase of incident response, from preparation to recovery.

8. **Active Directory** - Core environment for user and resource management, creating a realistic setting for attack simulations and responses.

Each tool is integral to achieving a practical and robust cybersecurity defense and incident response setup.
