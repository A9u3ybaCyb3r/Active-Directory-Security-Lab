# Active Directory Security Lab

## Objective

This lab aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory security and threat detection. To achieve this, the lab will focus on several key areas: gaining hands-on experience with Splunk as an SIEM tool, utilizing Kali Linux for penetration testing and simulating real-world attack scenarios, leveraging LimaCharlie for endpoint detection and response (EDR), and developing skills in identifying and responding to common Active Directory security threats. 

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization: Installing and configuring VMware software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- Active Directory Fundamentals: Gain a solid understanding of how domain environments function within Active Directory.
- SIEM Implementation: Learn to set up and utilize Splunk as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool for collecting and analyzing security data.
- Log Management: Master ingesting security events into an SIEM system for efficient analysis.
- Threat Detection Techniques: Develop skills in identifying and responding to common Active Directory security threats, enhancing my ability to protect domain environments.
- Attack Simulation and Mitigation: Learned how to simulate common attacks on Active Directory environments and implement defense strategies using real-time telemetry and alerts from Splunk.
- Incident Response: Learn to respond to security incidents, identify attack vectors, and use SIEM data to quickly mitigate threats.
- Network Traffic Analysis: Understand how to analyze network traffic and detect suspicious behavior or patterns that could indicate a security breach.

### Tools Used

- Virtualbox: A virtualization software platform used to create and manage virtual machines.
- Ubuntu Desktop: A free and open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. It provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of applications for personal and professional use.
- Active Directory: A Microsoft directory service that manages user accounts, computers, and other network resources.
- Splunk: A powerful SIEM platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on machine data.
- Kali Linux: A popular penetration testing distribution containing a wide range of tools for vulnerability assessment and ethical hacking.
