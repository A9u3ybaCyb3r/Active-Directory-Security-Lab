# Splunk-Powered Active Directory Threat Detection

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to develop a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory security and threat detection. To achieve this, the lab will focus on several key areas: gaining hands-on experience with Splunk as a SIEM tool, utilizing Kali Linux for penetration testing and simulating real-world attack scenarios, understanding the role of Atomic Red Team in generating realistic attack telemetry, and developing skills in identifying and responding to common Active Directory security threats. 

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization: Installing and configuring VMware software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- Active Directory Fundamentals: Gain a solid understanding of how domain environments function within Active Directory.
- SIEM Implementation: Learn to set up and utilize Splunk as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool for collecting and analyzing security data.
- Log Management: Master the art of ingesting security events into a SIEM system for efficient analysis.
- Threat Simulation: Understand the role of Atomic Red Team in generating realistic attack telemetry, mimicking real-world threats to hone your detection skills.
- Threat Detection Techniques: Develop skills in identifying and responding to common Active Directory security threats, enhancing your ability to protect domain environments.

### Tools Used

- VMware: A virtualization software platform used to create and manage virtual machines.
- Active Directory: A Microsoft directory service used to manage user accounts, computers, and other network resources.
- Splunk: A powerful SIEM platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on machine data.
- Kali Linux: A popular penetration testing distribution containing a wide range of tools for vulnerability assessment and ethical hacking.
- Atomic Red Team: A framework used to generate realistic attack telemetry for security testing and training purposes.
