# Blue-Team-Virtual-Security-Lab

## Objective

This lab serves as a safe and controlled space to practice various security skills, including networking, virtual machine communication, log analysis, SIEM operations, malware analysis, and more. By building virtual machines and configuring a network with a firewall, you can simulate real-world scenarios and gain hands-on experience with security tools and techniques.

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization: Installing and configuring VMware software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- Network Security: Understanding network concepts (VLANs, subnets, IP addressing), configuring virtual networks with pfSense firewall, setting up network segmentation, and implementing network security controls.
- Network Configuration and Management: Understanding the setup and management of virtual networks, including VLAN configurations.
- Windows Security: Implementing security measures on Windows servers and workstations, including hardening practices.
- Security Monitoring and Logging: Setting up and configuring logging mechanisms and monitoring solutions to capture security events.
- Incident Response: Developing and practicing incident response plans, including identification, containment, eradication, and recovery from security incidents.
- Threat Detection: Utilizing tools and techniques for detecting threats, including signature-based and behavioral detection methods.
- Malware Analysis: Understanding malware behavior, conducting static and dynamic analysis, and using various tools for analysis.
- Vulnerability Assessment: Conducting assessments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities within systems and applications.
- Security Policy Development: Creating and implementing security policies and procedures to govern organizational security practices.
- Forensic Analysis: Learning techniques for digital forensics, including data recovery and analysis of compromised systems.
- SIEM Configuration: Setting up and configuring Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions for centralized logging and threat detection.
- Threat Hunting: Engaging in proactive threat hunting to identify potential security threats before they escalate.


### Tools Used


- VMware: A virtualization software platform used to create and manage virtual machines.
- pfSense: An open-source firewall software used to create a secure network gateway for the virtual lab environment.
- Kali Linux: A Linux distribution pre-loaded with various security and penetration testing tools.
