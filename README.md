# Active Directory Security Lab

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to develop a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory security and threat detection. To achieve this, the lab will focus on several key areas: gaining hands-on experience with Splunk as an SIEM tool, utilizing Kali Linux for penetration testing and simulating real-world attack scenarios, leveraging LimaCharlie for endpoint detection and response (EDR), and developing skills in identifying and responding to common Active Directory security threats. 

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization: Installing and configuring VMware software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- Active Directory Fundamentals: Gain a solid understanding of how domain environments function within Active Directory.
- SIEM Implementation: Learn to set up and utilize Splunk as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool for collecting and analyzing security data.
- Log Management: Master ingesting security events into an SIEM system for efficient analysis.
- Threat Detection Techniques: Develop skills in identifying and responding to common Active Directory security threats, enhancing your ability to protect domain environments.
- Attack Simulation and Mitigation: Learn how to simulate common attacks on Active Directory environments and implement defense strategies using real-time telemetry and alerts from LimaCharlie and Splunk.
- Incident Response: Learn to respond to security incidents, identifying attack vectors and using SIEM/EDR data to mitigate threats quickly.
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Develop expertise in using LimaCharlie to detect, monitor, and respond to endpoint security threats in real-time.
- Network Traffic Analysis: Understand how to analyze network traffic and detect suspicious behavior or patterns that could indicate a security breach.

### Tools Used

- Virtualbox: A virtualization software platform used to create and manage virtual machines.
- Active Directory: A Microsoft directory service that manages user accounts, computers, and other network resources.
- Splunk: A powerful SIEM platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on machine data.
- Kali Linux: A popular penetration testing distribution containing a wide range of tools for vulnerability assessment and ethical hacking.
- Lima Charlie: A comprehensive security operations platform offering real-time telemetry, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and security monitoring capabilities. LimaCharlie integrates with other tools, such as Splunk, to provide enhanced threat detection and mitigation.
