# Home-SIEM-Lab

## Objective

The objective of the lab is to build a home lab for Elastic SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) using a free Elastic account and a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). To learn how to generate security events on the Kali VM, set up an agent to forward data to the SIEM, and query and analyze the logs in the SIEM.

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization: Installing and configuring VMware software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- SIEM Fundamentals: Gain hands-on experience with Elastic SIEM, a popular tool for security monitoring and analysis.
- Log Management: Learn how to collect, forward, and analyze security logs from your Kali VM.
- Security Event Detection: Simulate security events like Nmap scans and see how SIEM detects them.
- Dashboarding and Alerting: Create visualizations to understand security trends and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
